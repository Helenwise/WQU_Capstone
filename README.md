Machine Learning Trading System

Abstract
The impact of Machine Learning Trading Systems on financial markets is growing every year and the trades generated by an 
algorithm now account for the majority of orders that arrive at stock exchanges. In this paper, I explore how to find a 
trading strategy via Supervised Machine Learning, a branch of Machine Learning that allows to find an optimal strategy.  
I show how different Supervised Machine Learning regression algorithms compare to each other in term of predictive accuracy. 
3 different Supervised Machine Learning regression algorithms are used with the SPDR S&P 500 trust daily data.  
The 3 different Supervised Machine Learning regression algorithms are Ridge, Lasso and XGBoost.
